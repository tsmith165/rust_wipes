# Slot Machine Refactor Status

## Current State

### Completed

-   Basic layout structure with three main sections:
    -   Row 1: Left character, slot machine, right character
    -   Row 2: Slot controls
    -   Row 3: Recent winners
-   Initial grid loading with random symbols
-   Basic sound system implementation
-   Recent winners display structure
-   Steam profile integration
-   Bonus type selection modal
-   Win overlay positioning
-   Proper animation flow:
    -   Get spin result from server first
    -   Create extended grid with random symbols + final grid
    -   Animate reels with proper timing
    -   Play sounds at correct intervals
